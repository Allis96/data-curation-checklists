# Data Curation Checklists

This repository contains Data Curation Checklists to supplement Data Curation Primers in our [main repository](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers).

Data curation primers are being developed as part of the IMLS grant #RE-85-18-0040-18 "Building the Data Curation Community: Advancing Specialized Data Curation".

**Revisions to data curation checklists** can be made by forking the checklist repository, making any preferred changes, then committing the revisions back to the original checklist repository. Please see our [contributors guide](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers/blob/master/Contributors.md) for more information on adding to these resources.

Please be advised data curation checklists and primers are licensed with [CC by 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Suggested citations are provided within each primer.
