# Data Curation Checklists

This repository contains Data Curation Checklists to supplement Data Curation Primers in our [main repository](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers). Checklists developed from the CURATED workflow established by the Data Curation Network. See the original document: [Checklist for DCN Curators](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWt2obXOOeJRRFmVo9VAkl4h41cL33Zm5YYny3hbPZ8/edit)

**Data curation primers** are being developed as part of the IMLS grant #RE-85-18-0040-18 "Building the Data Curation Community: Advancing Specialized Data Curation".

**Revisions to data curation checklists** can be made by forking the checklist repository, making any preferred changes, then committing the revisions back to the original checklist repository. Please see our [contributors guide](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers/blob/master/Contributors.md) for more information on adding to these resources.
